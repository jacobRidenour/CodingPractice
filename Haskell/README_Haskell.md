# Haskell

The Haskell programming language supports functional (declarative) programming. Its type system is static, inferred, and nominal. 

Function parameters are passed by value (copied), but values are typically not computed until needed due to using a lazy evaluation model.

Haskell was first standardized in 1990. The [Haskell Report](https://wiki.haskell.org/Language_and_library_specification), its free specification, was last updated in 2010.

Like C, multiple implementations exist. This project focuses on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (`ghc`), which provides both ahead of time (AOT) compilation and an interpreter.
